                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Your email address when you register for an account. We do not collect passwords; all authentication is handled securely by Firebase Authentication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data (Guests):</strong> For non-registered users, we store a simple, anonymous counter in your browser's session to enforce the "3 free uses" trial. This counter is not linked to any personal information.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="mt-5">What We Do NOT Collect</h3>
                <p class="lead">We do not store, log, or review the contents of the log files you upload.</p>
                <p>All file processing and AI analysis is done in-memory. The log file you upload is deleted from our server immediately after the analysis is complete. The AI-generated solutions are also not stored.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-5">How We Use Your Information</h3>
                <p>We use your email address *only* to provide you with access to your account and to provide unlimited access to the Service's features.</p>
